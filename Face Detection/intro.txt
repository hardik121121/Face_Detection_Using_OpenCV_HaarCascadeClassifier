Face Detection Application

Description:
This Python application uses OpenCV to detect faces using a webcam in real time. The application utilizes the Haar Cascade Classifier (`haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml`) to identify faces from the live video feed.

Usage Instructions:
1. Ensure that the `haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml` file is in the same directory as this script.
2. To run the application:
   - Open a terminal/command prompt in the folder containing the script.
   - Run the script using Python:
     ```bash
     python app.py
     ```
3. The webcam feed will open, and faces will be detected in real-time.
4. Press the 'q' key to quit the application at any time.

Key Features:
- Real-time face detection using the webcam.
- Displays rectangles around detected faces.
- Prints the result of face detection once the application is stopped.
- Option to exit the application by pressing 'q'.

Output:
Once the application exits, the result of the face detection session will be printed in the terminal:
- "A face was detected during the session." if a face was detected.
- "No face was detected during the session." if no face was detected.

Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV library (`opencv-python`)
- NumPy library (required for OpenCV)

Installation:
To install the necessary libraries, run the following commands:
```bash
pip install opencv-python
pip install numpy
